# Algorithm Visualizer

This project is an interactive algorithm visualizer, designed to help users understand and visualize how different sorting algorithms work. The visualizer provides a UI where users can input an array of numbers and adjust the speed of the sorting animation. It includes various sorting algorithms and displays a step-by-step visual process of each sort.
